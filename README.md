I have created a new project named Expanding Cards.

In this project we have 5 images one of them is expanded at first and the other stay wrapped.

Whenever  the user click one of the images, it expands and the other get wrapped.

I used basic htm, css and javascript fir this project.

The pictures are random from the website unsplash. So every time we renew the pages we get news pictures.
